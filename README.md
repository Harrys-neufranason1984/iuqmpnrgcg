Dude, just finished watching The Woman in the Yard. Holy crap, that was a trip. 😆 Like, I was expecting something kinda chill, but instead, it's like, bam, there’s this woman and she’s... well, let’s just say she’s not your average neighbor, you know what I mean? I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Seriously, it’s one of those flicks you gotta download the movie just to watch all those crazy details again. It's like, what is even happening right now?!

And the music, man, don’t even get me started. It's like this eerie, creepy vibe that keeps you like, in this state of, I dunno, suspense and sheer confusion? LOL. They really nailed it with that one. One second you’re like, “okay, I kinda get it,” and the next, whoosh, there goes your understanding, right out the window. 😂

> Also, can we talk about the part where the dog starts barking at nothing? My mind was like, overdrive. I swear dogs in movies always see way more than we do. They should just be the main characters at this point, solving all the mysteries. 😂 And that thing with the red scarf? That was just next-level weird, right? I still don't even know what it was about, but it definitely added to the “what the heck?” vibe of the whole thing.

Anyway, part of me thinks I'm too tired for this kind of intense viewing right now. Totally gonna need a second round to catch everything my sleepy brain missed. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Like, I tried to watch the movie all focused and stuff, but you know when you're just so tired every noise sounds like ghost footsteps? Yeah, that's me right now. 😴

var x = 100; // just...why did I type this? no clue. LOL

But hey, worth it for sure, though probably shouldn’t wait till midnight next time, haha. Are you gonna watch it? If you haven't yet, you totally should. Just, maybe earlier in the evening when your mind is still functioning somewhat normally. 😉
